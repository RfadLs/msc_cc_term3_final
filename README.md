Coding Three: Exploring to Machine Intelligence course:

Project Description: The project aims to learn a model that can generate clear images of playing cards. The project uses DCGANs for realistic image generation using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. Specifically, it collected a dataset of playing card images, preprocessed them, and built generator and discriminator models. The generator creates realistic images, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated ones. I then repeated the training and optimization process to arrive at an improved, highly defined model that could generate clear images of the playing cards.
