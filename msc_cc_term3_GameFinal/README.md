Name: Qintong Yu

Project Title: Untrammeled

Project description:

Dr. Voss, a scientist obsessed with a thirst for knowledge that can never be quenched, gazed into the depths of the Quantum Window that was her greatest invention, a window to the very fabric of reality. What she was about to do in her relentless quest for enlightenment would only give warning to what lay on the perilous path ahead. Her coming upon the quantum window again blurs the lines between what is known to be reality and unknown possibilities, throwing her into a tug-of-war over the possible consequences that her quest might unveil. She remembers the Guardian's words all too well: "Knowledge may seem like a candle in the dark, yet darkness may be casting those long shadows." Promising scientific discoveries that have never yet appeared, Dr. Voss has to decide if enlightenment is worth falling from the grasp of reality. In a moment of lucidity, almost physical, she is caught in a world of unearthly beauty and premonition in a flash that the ancient knowledge could come apart and pull all she knows apart at the seams. Despite this chilling certainty, Dr. Voss goes on with a relentless determination as the quantum window flares to life. She steps through it into the unknown, awaiting the confrontation of ultimate truths in the universe, where she might find enlightenment or plunge into madness.
